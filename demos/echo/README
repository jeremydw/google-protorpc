Echo Service
============

The echo service is a service that echos a request back to the caller.  Useful
for testing and illustrates all data types in the forms interface.

Google App Engine
=================

For more information about Google App Engine, and to download the SDK, see:

  http://code.google.com/appengine

Running locally
===============

ProtoRPC must be installed in the echo directory in order for it to work.

Example on a unix-like OS:

  $ cp -r $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/echo

To run this demo locally, you need to run an instance of the Google App
Engine dev-appserver.  The server defaults on port 8080.

Example on a unix-like OS:

  $ python $GAE_SDK/dev_appserver.py $PROTORPC/demos/echo
