Running locally
===============

There are two Google App Engine applications in this demo, server and client.
In order for each application to work it needs to have a link to or a copy of
the protorpc library.

Example on a unix-like OS:

  $ cp -r $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/tunes_db/client &
  $ cp -r $PROTORPC/python/protorpc $PROTORPC/demos/tunes_db/server &

To run this demo locally, you need to run two instances of the Google App
Engine dev-appserver, one for the server and the other for the client.  The
server must be run on port 8082.

Example on a unix-like OS:

  $ python $GAE_SDK/dev_appserver.py $PROTORPC/demos/tunes_db/client &
  $ python $GAE_SDK/dev_appserver.py -p 8082 $PROTORPC/demos/tunes_db/server &
